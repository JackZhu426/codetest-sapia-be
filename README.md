# Sapia Codetest

## About the project

This is a back-end project to meet the Login requirement on Sapia's codetest. It is built with NodeJS, TypeScript, MongoDB and Docker, alongwith a bunch of third-party libraries including Jest (for testing), Express (Web app framework), Bcrypt (for password hashing) etc.

It connects to the MongoDB and provides **User Login** and **User Register** (just for the convenience for anyone who wants to login with his/her preferred username and password) features. Main user scenarios include as follows:

- User puts the right username and password, return 'success'
- User puts the username which does NOT exist:
  - return 'failed', alongside the error message: 'username does not exist!'
- User puts the username which exsists:
  - User puts the wrong password less than 3 times under 5 min, return 'failed', alongside the error message: Password is wrong! Please try again!
  - User puts the wrong password which hits 3 times in 5 min, return 'failed', alongside the error message: You have failed to try 3 times! Account is locked!
  - When this particular user has been lock, no matter he puts the right or wrong password, return 'failed', alongside the error message: account is locked! Please try again after `X` min
- After 5min, the user who hass has been lcoked before should be unclocked, he/she can login again ðŸŽ‰

## Getting Started

After downloading this project, you can run this app by following simple steps

### Installation

> For testing convenience, I kept the `.env` config file in the project in the root dir

1. Instal JavaScript package manager NPM

```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```

2. Install NPM packages

```sh
npm i
```

### Usage

#### Run on Docker

After your Docker launch, run the following command:

```sh
docker compose up
```

You will see there are two **_Containers_** created and running, which are `jack-codetest-mongo` and `jack-codetest-server`, then you can test APIs it on **Postman** (or any other API testing tool you like)

#### Test on Postman

The server is running on your localhost which is `http://localhost`, and the Port I put is `3001`, so the base url is `http://localhost:3001/`

There are 2 APIs `register` and `login`, both take JSON body and required keys are `username` (String) and `password` (String), example is shown below:

| Request |   API    |                                     Body |
| ------- | :------: | ---------------------------------------: |
| POST    | register | { "username": "jack", "password": "123"} |
| POST    |  login   | { "username": "jack", "password": "123"} |
